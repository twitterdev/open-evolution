## Introduction

The `liked` and `retweeted` flags are needed to make better use of tweet data retrieved from the **Twitter API v2.0**.

## Motivation

**Twitter API v2.0** does not provide a way to programmatically determine if a particular tweet retrieved from the API has been **liked** or **retweeted** by an authenticated user.

By having no way of knowing these states, users of the Twitter API v2.0 will not be able to make the following UI representations in third-party apps they create.

![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13072231/174460422-92c7dd5f-10db-40b0-bc45-28a950dc141d.png)

For example, to reproduce the above tweet status in a third-party application using only Twitter API v2.0, the third-party application must remember that a particular tweet has been liked or retweeted.

## Proposed solution

- Add `liked` and `retweeted` enums in `tweet.fields` as a request parameter.
- Add `liked` and `retweeted` fields to `Tweet Object`.

## Detailed design
