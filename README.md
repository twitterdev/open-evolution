# Twitter API open evolution


This repository allows you to submit proposals to change aspects of the Twitter public API.

## Submitting a proposal

Anyone can submit a proposal for consideration by Twitter. Proposals must conform to a defined template, and must respect the [general principles of the Twitter API platform](principles.md).

Before submitting a proposal, we strongly encourage you to start a discussion by opening an issue on Github, and to seek consensus and input from the broader developer community.

## Workflow

1.  Fork this repository.
2.  Make a copy [proposal-template.md](proposal-template.md), and rename it so that the title describes the proposal (it can have the same title as your proposal). Use a format like `000-your-proposal-name.md`, where `your-proposal-name` is a descriptive name (e.g. the proposal title), keeping `000` for the numeric part.
3.  Fill the proposal template by following the instructions on the template.
4.  Submit a pull request. As soon as a review manager is available, they will contact the authors to discuss the proposal.
5.  Once a review is scheduled, be ready and prepared to discuss your proposal with the review manager. Expect the process to last no more than 15 working days.
6.  At the end of the review process, a decision will be made and the proposal can be approved or rejected. The review manager can also request you to submit a revision; in this case, the proposal is sent back and another review will be scheduled.

## Important things to note

-   When a submission is accepted, it means that Twitter agrees in principle with the proposed changes. This does not mean that the proposal will be immediately implemented.
-   While all decisions are final and may not be appealed, rejected proposals can be revised and resubmitted, as long as they respect the [general principles of the Twitter API platform](principles.md).
-   It is the responsibility of the authors to check that the proposal is not a duplicate of a previously accepted or rejected proposal.
-   Submissions must adhere to the [general principles of the Twitter API platform](principles.md). Submissions that do not meet these requirements may be rejected without a review. In this case, a core team member (possibly the member who flagged the rejection candidate) will assign themselves as a review manager to execute the rejection, or to ask the author to submit a revision.
-   A review can terminate early when a proposal is withdrawn from consideration, or when a decision can be made within the review period.

## Statuses

At any given time, a proposal can be in one of the following statuses:

-   **Open.** The initial status of a proposal.
-   **Reviewable.** The proposal has been accepted by a review manager. The review manager proceeds to schedule a review period and communicate it to the authors.
-   **Reviewing.** The proposal is in active review.
-   **Withdrawn.** The authors withdrew the proposal.
-   **Rejected.** The proposal has been reviewed and rejected.
-   **Approved.** The proposal has been reviewed and approved.
-   **Revision needed.** The proposal has been reviewed but it needs to be sent back to the authors for changes before it can be rejected or approved.
-   **Superseded.** A newer or more relevant proposal or implementation makes this proposal obsolete or no longer applicable. This status applies to open or approved proposals.

Remember: When a submission is accepted, it means that Twitter agrees in principle with the proposed changes. This does not mean that the proposal will be implemented. This can happen for example when further privacy and security review highlight a risk, or when there is a change in roadmap or priorities, or in case of an already scheduled release of related functionality that supersedes a proposal.

## What to expect

- You can submit a proposal at any time for review. Submissions can be in the Open state for a while, but we will review all proposals.
- Once a proposal is in review, you can expect the review to take 15 business days. Sometimes, company and country holidays may get in the way; if that happens, we will add more time to the review process.
- You can expect infrequent but timely communication. That's what we'll be expecting too.
- You can expect feedback that motivates a rejection.
